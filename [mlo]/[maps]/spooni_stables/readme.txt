It is important that all objects are in it, but of course only those that you have purchased will work.

-------------How the Stables Works-------------------------
The Stables are rainproof with the stop-rainfall. 
Place the Stable wherever you want than,
place the stop-rainfall exactly on the same coordinates.
export it as ymap. 
You can save everything you place in the stables in the same ymap file.
----------------------------------------------------------
have fun.
